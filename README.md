# FastScriptEditor-Loader
We've all been there. Accidentally closing visual studio because you were too eager to minimize VS and test your newly created masterpiece in Unity. 
Only to find out you still need to make a tiny change. Then having to wait at least 5 minutes for VS to open up again and find all of it's references. Well.... No more!

With this tool you can right click on a c# script in Unity and choose 'Open with VS Code' or 'Open with Notepad++' to quickly load your script and make a small change without having to reload the entire VS solution.

You can - pretty easily - add your own fast editor of choice. 
Enjoy!
