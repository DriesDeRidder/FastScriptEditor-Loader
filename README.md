# QuickFixer
We've all been there. Closing visual studio because you were sure you were done and ready to test your newly created masterpience. And upon closing Visual Studio, you realize you forgot a tiny detail. 
Then having to wait 5 minutes (that feel like an hour since you just want to get it over with) for VS to open up again and find all of it's references. Well.... No more!

With this tool you can right click on a c# script in Unity and choose 'Open with VS Code' or 'Open with Notepad++', to quickly load your script and make a small change without having to reload the entire VS solution.

You can - pretty easily - add your own fast editor of choice. such as Sublime Text ,...
Enjoy!
